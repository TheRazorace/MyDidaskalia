MyDidaskalia - Zoom optimization, a human-computer interaction project

This project is about designing an application named "MyDidaskalia" used for modern online lessons. The first part of the project was evaluating well known applications used for this purpose. The second part was choosing one of those applications (Zoom was chosen) and trying to improve it following human-computer interaction rules.
